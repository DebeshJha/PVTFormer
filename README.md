# CT Liver Segmentation Via PVT-based Encoding and Refined Decoding

## Overview
PVTFormer is a novel encoder-decoder framework designed for precise liver segmentation from CT scans. At its core, it utilizes the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT v2) as a pretrained encoder, enhancing the segmentation process with its unique ability to handle variable-resolution input images and produce multi-scale representations.

## Key Features
-**Innovative Encoder-Decoder Framework:** Incorporates PVT v2 for efficient and rich feature extraction.

-**Hierarchical Decoding Strategy:** Enhances semantic features for high-quality segmentation masks.

-**Efficient Feature Processing:** Combines residual learning with Transformer mechanisms for optimal feature representation.

-**High Performance Metrics:** Achieves impressive dice coefficients and mean IoUs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
